"""CGen Intelligence - Code Generation Intelligence Layer (Layer 2).

This is the revolutionary layer where unconstrained Python analyzes static Python
to generate optimized C code. This layer has access to:

- Full Python ecosystem and libraries
- Machine learning models for optimization
- Symbolic mathematics and formal verification
- Database queries and web APIs
- Complex algorithms for optimization
- Multi-pass analysis and transformation

Key capabilities:
- Compile-time computation beyond traditional limits
- Intelligent loop transformations
- Machine learning-guided optimization
- Database-driven specialization
- Formal verification and proof generation
- Cross-language optimization
