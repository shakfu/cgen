# cgen

A python code to c code translator.


## Credits

- cgen uses quite a bit of code from Conny Gustafsson'w [cfile]() project in `cgen.generator`, to the extent that the respective license of `cfile` is included in that sub-package. Indeed cgen started off as a fork of `cfile`. Most likely cgen would not have existed if it wasn't for `cfile`. If the same sub-package evolves further it should be contributed back the `cfile` project.
